## About this repository
This repository will contain some old scripts I made for the FiveM server client

These scripts are based on the [ESX Framework](https://github.com/esx-framework) for FiveM servers.

## esx_joblisting2
esx_joblisting2 was created as an extension of the already available esx_joblisting. This scripts enables players to apply to whitelisted jobs through the in-game client by sending the application to a Discord channel.

## esx_gunshot
esx_gunshot enables players to check if another player recently has fired a gun (gun residue test).
